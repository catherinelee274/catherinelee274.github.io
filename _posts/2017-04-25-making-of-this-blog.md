Here I will go in-depth and cover the challenges of creating my portfolio and how I tackled them.

# Launching and Creating the Website With Jekyll

Simple enough, Github provides a free url using your Github Username and it is generated through Github Pages. I wanted the initial page, or "landing page" to include significant links like resume, github, and blog. The blog page would be a separate site/folder on my Github website which would document my trials as I traversed the world of code.   

Later on I am planning to add square tiles of all the projects I've worked on. 

# Folder Organization 
If you want a certain page to have a certain name.. Ex: if wanted some file called snowflake, make a folder called snowflake and name the index.html file anything and it will show up as ..../snowflake.html

# Integrating with a template

Pixyll is a Jekyll theme that was designed by John Otander. I fell in love with the minimalist style and I knew I wanted my blog to look like that. However, I only wanted the theme to be for my side page, which turned out to be more challenging than I imagined. The template was in Sass and being able to understand it involved reading up on documentation.
