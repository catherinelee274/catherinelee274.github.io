Here I will go in-depth and cover the challenges of creating my portfolio and how I tackled them.

# Launching and Creating the Website With Jekyll

Simple enough, Github provides a free url using your Github Username and it is generated through Github Pages. I wanted the initial page, or "landing page" to include significant links like resume, github, and blog. The blog page would be a separate site/folder on my Github website which would document my trials as I traversed the world of code.   

Later on I am planning to add square tiles of all the projects I've worked on.
