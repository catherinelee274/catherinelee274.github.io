The REU program stands for Research Experience for Undergraduates. It is meant as a way to break the ice into research for college students and encourage students to learn more about Grad School. 

In the summer of my freshman year, I attended the REU program at the University of California, San Diego. It was under Ryan Kastner's lab, as a part of a program called "Engineers for Exploration." 

On the first day, like anyone else, I was nervous. This was, afterall, the first "real job" that I ever had relating to my field, so I did not know what to expect, but everyone was very laid-back. I even made a meme out of my boss. On the first day. 

Over the course of the day, I would learn about the different projects varying from FPGAs and drones, species classification, and lidar. We took a short break in the middle to eat at a sandwich shop with a breathtaking view of the beach. At UCSD, they weren't lying when they said they are walking distance from the beach.  

Of all the projects that were introduced, what struck out to me was not one particular project (that wouldn't happen until the end of the week), but I was encouraged to take the one most interesting, not necessarily the one I was 100% qualified for. Everyone was really here to help me learn. 

I resolved that no matter where I go. I should always have this kind of freedom to choose projects that I am passionate about, and be able to approach them with the ultimate goal of learning.
