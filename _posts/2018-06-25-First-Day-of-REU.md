Was nervous, but everyone was really chill. Even memed my mentor. 
Learned about the culture of academia. Learned that you could be a software engineer (aka not a phd student or prof) and still be in a lab at a university.

Good comraderie with mangrove group... 

......psychological safety.....

awkward at first but you realize most REU's are to help you learn/emphasizes learning.
