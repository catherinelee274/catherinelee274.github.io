I joined a SWE Practice Technical Interview group at my school, so I have been revisiting my data structures.

I have this bad habit of looking at a technical interview problem and then when it gets challenging, telling myself that I will go back to it. I knew it was a bad habit, but I didn't know how widespread this problem was until getting into my technical interview prep group. I wasn't a bad programmer; I just didn't have enough practice.
