# What exactly is P vs. NP?

As I've learned over a random bout of procrastination, P vs. NP is a debate that has stumped computer scientists and mathematicians of this era. "P" stands for polynomial time and "NP" stands for non-deterministic polynomial time in reference to the time it takes for an algorithm to run. The reason this is such a provocative question is that if P= NP, that would destroy the foundation of cryptography, because crytopgraphy depends on the fact that hashing algorithms are mathematically "hard" to solve. Most academics believe that P != NP. However, on the other, if P=NP, that means some things are doomed to be computationally hard and will never have an algorithm that solves it efficiently, like for example, sequencing the human genome.

However, as this is all theoretical, whether or not P = NP or P!= NP does mean those that are NP are instantly solveable, but that a solution is possible.
